# Extend your program above. Draw five stars, but between each,
# pick up the pen, move forward by 350 units, turn right by 144,
# put the pen down, and draw the next star. Youâ€™ll get something like this
# (note that you will need to move to the left before drawing your first star in order to fit everything in the window):
